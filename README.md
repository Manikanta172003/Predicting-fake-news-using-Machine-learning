Since fake news tends to spread fast than real news there is a need to classify news as fake or not. In this project, the dataset used is from the Kaggle website where real news and fake news are in one dataset and trained with different machine learning classification algorithms to classify the news as fake or not. In this project, different feature engineering methods for text data have been used like the tfidf vectorizer and word embedding model which is going to convert the text data into feature vectors which is sent to machine learning algorithms to classify the news as fake or not. With different features and classification algorithms we are going to classify the news as fake or real and the algorithm with the feature which gives us the best result with that feature extraction method and that algorithm, we are going to predict the news as fake or real.
